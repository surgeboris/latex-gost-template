# latex-gost-template

The goal is to facilitate Emacs org-mode (and compilation-mode) to generate
LaTeX-formatted paper.

Forked from
[ledovsky/latex-gost-template](https://github.com/ledovsky/latex-gost-template),
which is based on
[latex-g7-32/latex-g7-32](https://github.com/latex-g7-32/latex-g7-32) (thanks to all contributors).
